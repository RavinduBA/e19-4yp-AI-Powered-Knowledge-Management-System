National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) play a crucial role in supporting academic and research communities 
by providing advanced technological infrastructure and services. As these organizations grow in complexity, there is an 
increasing need for efficient knowledge management systems to support their operations. This research aims to explore 
the potential of AI-powered knowledge management systems in enhancing the operational efficiency of NRENs, with a 
focus on managing institutional knowledge, training materials, and administrative guidelines.
